# CS234 Final Project
## This website's topic is Taylor Swift's recently re-released album 1989. The site features various images of her wearing her Eras Tour 1989 outfit and the seagulls featured on the album cover. There is also two polls, one regarding favorite songs and the other about favorite colorways of relevant topics.

## These polls connect to tables (color, song) within a database and store the results along with username and password (registration). These polls have a one-to-many relationship with the registration table so that the submissions are associated with the logged in user.

## In order to access it, one must sign up/login to enter. Upon submitting, it will test if username is already taken or not. All pages must have a set session name, else it will redirect you to the login page. Admin has a special page where you can delete, edit, or add users, song poll submission, or color poll submission. All data from each table is displayed so you know what previously exists.
